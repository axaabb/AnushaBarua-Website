        <p class="lead mb-4">I am currently a student at the University of California, Riverside. I aspire to work in healthcare in the future. I want to work directly with patients. By working directly with patients, I will be able to help them in a way that fits my aspirations of working in a career that allows me to advance my medical knowledge and gaining one-on-one experience. I am interested in working in a hospital or private practice.
        I want to become a doctor because I will be able to stay connected to field of science while helping others. Also by becoming a doctor, I will be able to continue learning about science and will be able to apply my knowledge wherever I go. For example if I am on vacation but come across someone who is a medical emergency, I will be able to help the that person at that moment. Also my family, friends, or neighbors will have someone near them that they can go to for medical advice or help. I want to make a positive impact for others and want to help them as much as they need. I will be very happy to provide any information that may help them move to a better position. <br><br>

         I am very interested in working in dermatology, pediatrics, and psychiatry. I am very passionate about skincare and have always had an interest in helping others with their skincare. I am always intrigued by the information I come across about skincare and know that I would do well working in dermatology. I have experience working with children in the past in different settings such as the hospital, schools, and my neighborhood. By spending much time with children, I was able to learn about how they view things, how to deal with various situations involving children, and how to communicate with them so that they can understand me and concepts that may be difficult to comprehend at first. In high school, I took my first psychology course. I was fascinated by the concepts and experiments that I was learning. Later on, I took a few more courses on psychology and realized how much I loved learning about the mind and the way that it worked. I started watching videos and reading more about psychological topics. I would spend hours on the content and would never get bored of constantly going through psychological content. I looked at possibilities for careers that combined both psychology and medicine. Once I discovered the occupation of psychiatry, I realized that being a psychiatrist was something that I wanted to do. <br><br>

        My goals currently consist of attending medical school so that I can become a physician one day. I am aware that being a student in medical school requires a lot of hard work but I will work hard and try my best to achieve the goal that I desire. While studying to become a physician, I plan to gain experience working in healthcare by either volunteering or working at a part-time job in a setting related to medicine.
